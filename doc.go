/*
Package slogscope is a custom slog handler for Go, designed to allow fine-grained control over
log levels on a per-package basis. This package provides an easy way to define different logging levels for individual
packages, making it simpler to manage and debug large applications with varying levels of verbosity.

Please see https://github.com/apperia-de/slogscope for more details.
